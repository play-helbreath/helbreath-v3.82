"So you want to enter into the world
of Magic? Then listen carefully. There
were many people who tried to become a
grand wizard(or sorcerer) and failed. 
That was because they were bewitched
by the power of magic and lost them
selves in it. If you wish to become a
great wizard (or sorcerer) always keep
in mind you should learn control and
try to over come the power of the Mana 
and free yourself from its influence. 
Are you sure you can do it? 
I wish you luck."
