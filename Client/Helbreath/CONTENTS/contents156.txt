"Have you come to learn magic?
You shall be taught if you have
the ability... However, I forbid
my magic to be used against the
innocent village people. Can you
give me your word that you will
not use it against the village
people? In any situation, if you
are caught using my magic in a
unworthy manner I shall not
stand by..."
